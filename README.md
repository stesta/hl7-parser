# HL7 Parser

Not intended for any sort of real world use.  
This is a toy project to start learning more about Megaparsec and parser combinators in Haskell.

## Learning Goals  

- [x] Basic Parsing 
- [ ] Backtracking/Look Ahead (more than just the simple `try` use-case)
- [ ] Lexing 

## Current Problems

- [ ] Lexing an `NM` field was not working correctly using `L.signed sc L.decimal`
